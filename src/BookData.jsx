    author: 'Mel Robbins',
    genre: 'Self Help',
    rating: '8.6/10',
    synopsis: 'Personal empowermentâ€”a breakout self-help phenomenon.',
    fullReview: `The "Let Them Theory," popularized by Mel Robbins, is a self-help concept centered on the idea of freeing oneself from the need to control or fix others, and instead focusing on personal agency and well-being. It emphasizes accepting that one cannot control others' thoughts, actions, or reactions, and encourages shifting focus to one's own behavior and response. The theory promotes personal growth, resilience, and inner peace by letting go of the need to control external factors and embracing acceptance.
    Key Principles of the Let Them Theory:
Acceptance of Others:
The core tenet is accepting that others will think, feel, and act in ways that may not align with your expectations or desires. This involves releasing the need to control or change them. 
Focus on Self:
Instead of expending energy trying to influence others, the theory advocates for focusing on personal growth, goals, and well-being. This includes setting boundaries to protect one's own energy and mental space. 
Personal Agency:
The theory acknowledges that while you cannot control others, you can control your own actions and reactions. This empowers individuals to take charge of their own lives and make choices that align with their values. 
Resilience and Inner Peace:
By letting go of the need to control external factors, individuals can cultivate resilience and find greater inner peace. This freedom from needing to manage others allows for more creativity, spontaneity, and a deeper sense of self-acceptance.  `
